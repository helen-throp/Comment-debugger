AIM: develop an AI which can read comments in code and check that they match what the code is actually doing

(Inspiration: "Don't Write Comments", Code Aesthetic, YouTube, 16/01/2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA)

Elevator pitch: when you update your code, do you also update the comments? Orphan comments (which reference code that has been changed or removed) can cause confusion down the line for end users and for code maintainers. This tool will, when finished, use AI to read comments and detect where they do not match the code.
